**Length**
Length is the track duration in minutes. 

The distribution of length appears to be right-skewed with a mean of 3.97 minutes and standard deviation of 0.64 (about 38 seconds). Due to her storytelling style of songwriting, her music tends to have a longer length. As she transitioned to pop music with *1989*, the overall length of her music began to decrease. Her albums *folklore* and *evermore* saw a return in her storytelling form, which resulted in longer songs.
