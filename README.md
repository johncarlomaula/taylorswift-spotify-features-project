# Analyzing Spotify Features of Taylor Swift's Music

**Project Description:** In this project, I retrieve Spotify features of Taylor Swiftâ€™s music and visualized them for analysis. I also developed a web app that compares the features of her re-recorded music with the original. 

For more information, check out my [blog](https://johncarlomaula.github.io/project1_swift) to see a summary write-up of the project. You can also view the app [here](https://johncarlomaula-taylorswift-spotify-features-pr-swift-app-zcv5ur.streamlit.app/).


**Main Goals:**
- Use the `Spotipy` package to retrieve the Spotify features of Taylor Swift's music
- Examine and compare the features of her albums using data visualization tools
- Compare the features of the re-recordings ("Taylor's Version") with the original
